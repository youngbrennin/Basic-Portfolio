        Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I will share a little information about myself about my journey up until this point in my life. I was born in
        Las Vegas, Nevada.. yes you heard me correct. Typically what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but look I made it to Arizona. I grew up on the fence
        of Phoenix and Scottsdale, Arizona with my mother. In my upbringing, I was surrounded by family selling real estate and being successful doing whatever
        they were doing. I knew that when I grew up this is exactly what I wanted to be.. successful. Now , over the years I have found new meaning to what success
        is and to many people where it could be either power, wealth, passion, a big house, or even married. These are all great success points, but what really
        stood out to me was passion. I knew that I wanted to be successful doing something that I loved, but discovering that was difficult without dipping your 
        toes in the waters of many pools.
                <br><br>
        I found my passion while I was in college at the W.P. Carey School of Business, which is one of the many schools located at Arizona State University, but I did 
        not graduate with my passion in mind because me degree focus was in Business Communication at the time and my only thought was to finish. I came across a resource 
        to where I could create something of my own, which turned out to be coding. I was teaching myself while I was in class. I loved it immediately because my interests 
        have always been to be creating something somewhere. For a while I thought I was going to be an architect but in the world of making choices, my path has taken 
        me here: a heavy interest in coing and the desire to create. I am now in the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. 
                <br><br>
        I do have an active life where I will spend time with friends and my soon to be wife. I enjoy a variety of things whether it might be:
                <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Going to the gym</li>
            <li>Hiking with friends</li>
            <li>Playing video games</li>
            <li>Going to see the latest movies</li>
            <li>and occasionally trying out new restaurants</li>
        </ul>
                <br>
        I am very excited to see where the future will take me and I cannot wait to code up a storm... that reminds me I need to get back to it!
